## Inspiration

Information regarding tournaments, teams, and Skills rankings is (for the most part) dominated by RobotEvents. However, Robotevents primarily serves as a registration hub for tournaments, and the Vexion team believes that a website dedicated to providing scouting information is imperative for any competitive team. Vexion aims to present data such as a team's winrate, Skills ranking, competition history amongst others. Furthermore, our core philosophy is to increase team agency, which we will execute by implementing functions such as "tracking", which allows a team to passively receive updates about a selected team's progression. 

Vexion is a trailblazer insofar as that no similar services exist; past sites such as vexscouting.com or VexDB have been discontinued for quite some time.
